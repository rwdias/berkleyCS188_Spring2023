# University of Berkeley CS 188 Spring - AI Projects

Welcome to the repository for my AI projects completed as part of the University of Berkeley's CS 188 course during the Spring semester. This repository contains a compendium of six AI projects that cover various concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Project 1: Search Algorithms**
   - Implement various search algorithms, including Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search, to solve problems and navigate environments.

2. **Project 2: Multi-Agent Search**
   - Design agents that cooperate and compete in complex environments, using adversarial search and minimax algorithms.

3. **Project 3: Reinforcement Learning**
   - Implement reinforcement learning algorithms, including Value Iteration and Q-Learning, to train agents to make decisions in dynamic environments.

4. **Project 4: Ghostbusters**
   - Develop probabilistic models to track the movements of hidden ghosts and design algorithms for capturing them efficiently.

5. **Project 5: Classification**
   - Implement classification algorithms, such as Perceptron and Naive Bayes, to categorize data and make predictions.

6. **Project 6: Pacman Capture the Flag**
   - Design multi-agent algorithms to compete in a capture-the-flag style game, incorporating adversarial and cooperative strategies.

## Usage
Each project folder contains detailed instructions on how to run and test the code. Make sure you read the documentation provided in each project directory before getting started.

## Requirements
- Python (version X.X)
- Additional requirements as specified in each project's documentation

## License
These projects are based on assignments from the University of Berkeley's CS 188 course. Please review the licensing information provided by the course instructors.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the professors and teaching assistants at the University of Berkeley for creating and guiding us through these interesting AI projects.

Feel free to explore each project's directory for more details!
